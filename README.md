# PublicIP

This simple code is initially used to provide a looking glass service for [Hello IT](https://github.com/ygini/Hello-IT): a way for a client behind a NAT to learn its public IP.

The service is initially hosted on ip.abelionni.com and provided here as a way to offload our original endpoint and to give you the ability to keep your user location undisclosed.
